## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy in marketing and business. This project aims to analyze customer data from a mall and group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing patterns and demographics. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to specific customer groups.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) from Kaggle. It contains information about customers, including their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PrakashMahatra/PRODIGY_ML_02.git
   cd mall-customer-segmentation
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Explore the distribution of variables such as age, annual income, and spending score.
- Visualize relationships between variables using scatter plots, histograms, and correlation analysis.
- Identify potential outliers and understand their impact on the analysis.

## Customer Segmentation

- Utilize unsupervised learning techniques like K-means clustering to segment customers.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method.
- Visualize customer segments using scatter plots or other relevant visualizations.

## Insights

The project aims to uncover insights such as:
- Characteristics of different customer segments (e.g., high-income, low-spending customers).
- How age and gender correlate with spending behavior.
- Strategies that can be employed to target different customer segments effectively.
